          The "revetlla de Sant Joan," celebrated on the night of June 23rd to
          24th, is an ancient festival linked to the summer solstice and deeply
          connected to fire. Traditionally, bonfires are lit and firecrackers
          set off to symbolize the transition from bad weather to calm, from
          darkness to light, and from winter to summer—serving as a form of
          purification and protection against negative energies. In Catalonia,
          the "Flama del Canigó" stands out, a symbolic flame that has been
          shared from the Pyrenees to cities across the region since 1966. The
          night includes communal dinners, music, nighttime sea bathing, and
          rituals with herbs that blend pagan traditions with Christian
          celebrations of Saint John the Baptist.
