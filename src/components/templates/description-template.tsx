        The "revetlla de Sant Joan," celebrated on the night of June 23rd to
        24th, is an ancient festival linked to the summer solstice and deeply
        connected to fire. Traditionally, bonfires are lit and firecrackers set
        off to symbolize the transition from bad weather to calm, from darkness
        to light, and from winter to summer—serving as a form of purification
        and protection against negative energies. In Catalonia, the "Flama del
        Canigó" stands out, a symbolic flame that has been shared from the
        Pyrenees to cities across the region since 1966. The night includes
        communal dinners, music, nighttime sea bathing, and rituals with herbs
        that blend pagan traditions with Christian celebrations of Saint John
        the Baptist.
